## thewh1teagle/vibe

**Repository:** https://github.com/thewh1teagle/vibe
**License:** MIT License
**Copyright:** (c) 2024 thewh1teagle

**Used in:**
- `src/lib/export-chat/docx.ts` - DOCX export pattern (Document structure, Paragraph formatting)

**Note:** Vibe's implementation uses a `Segment[]` schema with timestamps for video transcription. Hablará's implementation is adapted for `ChatMessage[]` schema with psychological metadata export (GFK, Cognitive Distortions, Four-Sides Model). Only the `docx` library usage pattern and document structure approach were referenced, not the actual code.
